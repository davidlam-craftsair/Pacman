### Description:
##### This project emulates the classic game of Pacman. It creates an animation of pacman opening and closing its mouth. It will bounce back to the opposite direction when hitting the screen edge.

### Future Development:
##### 1) To create a map including moving path for the pacman to move along.
##### 2) To add keyboard arrow keys control for user to control the direction of pacman to move.
##### 3) To generate "ghosts" for Pacman to eat. Over time Pacman will get smaller, he needs to feed on ghosts in order to maintain his size.
