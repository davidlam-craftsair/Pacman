# Pacman
### Description:
##### This project emulates the classic game of Pacmen. It creates an animation of pacman opening and closing its mouth. It will bounce back to the opposite direction when hitting the screen edge.

### Future Development:
#### 1) To create a map for the pacman to move along
#### 2) To add keyboard control for user to control the direction
#### 3) To generate ghosts for pacmen to eat in random locations
